increase (negatively amortize), and your loan amount will likely
become larger than your original loan amount. Increases in your
loan amount lower the equity you have in this property.

Escrow Account
For now, your loan

Escrow Waiver Fee
In the future,
Your property costs may change and, as a result, your escrow payment
may change. You may be able to cancel your escrow account,
but if you do, you must pay your property costs directly. If you fail to
pay your property taxes, your state or local government may (1)
impose fines and penalties or (2) place a tax lien on this property. If
you fail to pay any of your property costs, your lender may (1) add
the amounts to your loan balance, (2) add an escrow account to
your loan, or (3) require you to pay for property insurance that the
lender buys on your behalf, which likely would cost more and
provide fewer benefits than what you could buy on your own.
