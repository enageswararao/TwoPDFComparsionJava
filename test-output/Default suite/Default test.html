Additional Information About This Loan
Loan Disclosures
Assumption
If you sell or transfer this property to another person, your lender
will allow, under certain conditions, this person to assume this
loan on the original terms.
5 will not allow assumption of this loan on the original terms.
Demand Feature
Your loan

Late Payment
If your payment is more than 15.00 days late, your lender will charge
a late fee of 5% of the monthly principal and interest payment.
Negative Amortization (Increase in Loan Amount)
Under your loan terms, you
are scheduled to make monthly payments that do not pay all of
the interest due that month. As a result, your loan amount will
increase (negatively amortize), and your loan amount will likely
become larger than your original loan amount. Increases in your
loan amount lower the equity you have in this property.
may have monthly payments that do not pay all of the interest
due that month. If you do, your loan amount will increase
(negatively amortize), and, as a result, your loan amount may
become larger than your original loan amount. Increases in your

For now, your loan
5will have an escrow account (also called an &quot;impound&quot; or &quot;trust&quot;
account) to pay the property costs listed below. Without an
escrow account, you would pay them directly possibly in one or
two large payments a year. Your lender may be liable for penalties
and interest for failing to make a payment.

but if you do, you must pay your property costs directly. If you fail to
pay your property taxes, your state or local government may (1)

you fail to pay any of your property costs, your lender may (1) add
the amounts to your loan balance, (2) add an escrow account to
your loan, or (3) require you to pay for property insurance that the
lender buys on your behalf, which likely would cost more and
provide fewer benefits than what you could buy on your own.
